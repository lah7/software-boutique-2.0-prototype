# Software Boutique for Ubuntu MATE

An easy-to-use curvated software collection for Ubuntu MATE users.
Presented as part of the [Welcome program](https://bitbucket.org/ubuntu-mate/ubuntu-mate-welcome).


## Features

* One-click install recommended software tried and tested for the distribution.
* Simple tools to list and manage packages on the system.
* Apt and Snap support.


## Migration in Progress!

This tool was originally part of [Ubuntu MATE Welcome](https://github.com/ubuntu-mate/ubuntu-mate-welcome),
but it is currently being decoupled into its own stand-alone application.
